    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**1- Decision Trees:**\n",
    "- The Decision Tree model is a model that constructs a flowchart of questions that are structured hierarchically and based on these questions it makes predictions. It can be applied in real world in medical researches to determine the people that are susceptible to a certain disease or disorder. For example, if we have a dataset that includes information(Age, sex, marital status, number of children,...etc) about patients who have a certain disease or disorder we can build a decision tree model on these information and be able to predict whether a new person is susceptible to this disease or disorder or not. RESOURCES: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466856/\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Some of the strengths of the decision tree model are that it is very easy to understand as it can be thought of as a flowchart. It simplifies the relationship between different inputs as it divides them into subgroups to predict the outcome. It also classifies the data without too many calculations. It also requires minimal data preparation. This model performs well with large datasets as it can analyze them in a resonable time.

    "\n",
    "- some of the weaknesses of the decision tree model are that they tend to overfit and create complex trees that don't generalize the data very well but instead memorizes the training data, it is also subject to underfitting so we need to tune its hyperparameters to make sure the model doesn't overfit or overfit. It also performs poorly when the data contains outliers as a very small change in data can affect the structure of the decision tree. RESOURCES:\n",

    "- This model is a good candidate for this problem because we are dealing with a large dataset and as we mentioned above it performs very well with large datasets. Also most of the input data are of different categories so this algorithm would work well with our dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2- Support Vector Machines (SVM):**\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines SVMs can be used in many real-world applications as face detection and handwriting recognition. It can be used to detect the pixels of the image that contains a face by training the model on multiple images with pixels being labeled as having a part of the face or not. RESOURCES:\n",

    "https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/\n",
    "\n",
    "- The strengths of the SVM model are that it tends to maximize the minimum distance between the boundary and the classified points as it tends to maximize the margin between the boundary and the classified points ,and hence, avoiding overfitting. Another strength point is that it applies the kernel trick where we can have polynomial or rbf kernel that seperates our data which makes it capable of classifying non-lineary distributed datasets. Also the ability to tune the C and gamma hyperparameters makes the SVM algorithm a robust one as the model can be generalized very well even when the training data has some bias. So as we mentioned, the Support Vector Machines model performs very well when we have non-lineary distributed features and also when the training data has some bias as we can tune its parameters to generalize it.

    "- The weaknesses of the SVM model are that they are more complex and not easy to understand as the decision tree model as they need complex graphical visualizations to be able to comprehend them due to the fact that the model can be of a high degree. Also we have to tune its hyperparameters carefuly or otherwise it may be subject to overfitting. Also non linear SVM models are expensive to train. Another weakness is that it's a binary classification algorithm so if we need to apply it to non binary classification porblems we will need to apply the one vs all method. They perform poorly when the data is skewed or inbalanced and when the data is very large as they can be slow and expensive to compute. RESOURCES:\n",

    "**3- Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost):**\n",
    "- AdaBoost algorithm is used in computer vision. One of the applications that I have found online for it is basketball players recognition. It can be used to detect the position of a basketball player in an image or a video. Another application is that it can be used in the classification of power system states. It is trained on multiple voltage and current readings with the labels being safe or not safe and then it can predict whether a new voltage and current reading is considered safe for the system or not.

    "\n",
    "- The strengths points of AdaBoost algorithm are that it's very fast as we train several weak learners on a subset of the training data and then build our strong learner based on their predictions. It can also combine any learning algorithm, as the weak learners can be of any model. It is also versatile as it can be used for classification and regression problems. This model also performs very well when the data is not lineary seperable. RESOURCES:\n",

    "\n",
    "- The weaknesses of the AdaBoost algorithm are that its predictions are mainly based on the weak learners, so if all the weak learners make bad predictions then our strong learner will most probably make bad predicitons too. It is also subject to overfitting if the weak learners are too complex. It performs poorly when our data contains some uniform noise. RESOURCES:\n",

    "The best model for identifying individuals that make more than $50,000 is the AdaBoostClassifier model.\n",
    "- This model has the highest F-score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used. \n",
    "- This model have a low prediction/training time which is visualized by the graph above. When this model is compared with SVC, we can find a huge difference in the prediction/training time. Even though the decision tree classifier has the lowest training/prediction time, when we look at the F-score on the testing when 100% of the training data is used we can find that it has the lowest score of the 3 models and that's why I preferred to pick the AdaBoostClassifier.\n",
    "- This algorithm is very suitable for the data as it generalizes very well and doesn't overfit due to the fact that even though it may not have the best F-score on the training data but when we look at our testing data we can see that this model has the highest scores of the 3 models. Also, our problem is a binary classification one so our weak learners can be as simple as a horizontal line that seperates both predictions, which saves a lot of time."

    "\n",
    "- The chosen model(AdaBoostClassifier) works on training several simple models called \"weak learners\" and combining them to get our final model which is called \"strong learner\", The purpose of doing so is that our final model(strong learner) can make very good predictions without needing to have complex weak learners as they can be as simple as a horizontal line splitting our data. These weak learners can also be of any learning algorithm. The default simple models for AdaBoost are Decision Tree Classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main concept of this Algorithm is that each of these simple models \"weak learners\" predicts the output by asking multiple questions(I will try to explain how it works in detail using some examples). For example, The model will check to see whether the person has a Doctorate's degree or not, if this person has a doctorate degree then it may predict that he has an income of more than 50K, if not, then it may ask some other questions as how many hours do this person work? Where do this person live?,...etc. Based on the answers of these questions the model makes its predictions. So each of these simple models can be thought of as a flowchart of questions and based on the answers of these questions the predictions are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The AdaBoost algorithm then aggregates these models to give us our strong learner or our final model. This is done by calculating the accuracy and the error of each of these simple models to measure their performance. These scores are then used to weight the models where each model will be given a weight based on its score, a model that has a high score will have a large weight and a model that has a low score will consequently have a small weight. Moreover, if we have a model that makes false predictions its weight can be of a negative number. These weights are then added and combined to give us our strong learner. This process can be thought of as making our simple models vote for the predictions and make our predictions based on the result of this voting process."

    "    - capital-loss: I believe that this feature is more relative in predicting whether a person has an income of more than 50K or not. This is because if a person has had a high capital loss, it would greatly affect his income."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
